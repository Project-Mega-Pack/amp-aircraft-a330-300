DO NOT EDIT NORMAL FILES
	normal files for visual aid in Substance Painter

Drag and drop Metallic and roughness into their respective slots in a fill layer in substance.
The purpose behind this is so all the metallic and roughness properties of the default livery are not lost if adding or removing metallic or roughness to your livery.
